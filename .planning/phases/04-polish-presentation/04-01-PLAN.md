<objective>
Polish the app to presentation-ready enterprise quality for Wednesday's client demo.

Purpose: Transform the functional prototype into a visually polished, professional "Phase 1 Discovery Intelligence Report" that impresses the client.
Output: Refined sidebar branding, elevated header, consistent card/table/chart styling across all pages — demo-ready.

**Tech stack available:** Vite, React, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui v4, Recharts v3, lucide-react, oklch color system
**Established patterns:** oklch string literals for Recharts fills, sidebar CSS variables (bg-sidebar, text-sidebar-foreground), KPI Card pattern (Card > CardContent > p+p), bare h1/p page headers
**Constraining decisions:**
- Enterprise B2B aesthetic (Stripe/Linear style) — dark sidebar, light content, slate/zinc + blue/emerald accent
- No purple gradients or playful styling
- "Phase 1 Discovery Intelligence Report" branding throughout
- CONFIDENTIAL labels
- Desktop presentation only (no mobile responsiveness needed)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Polish sidebar branding and header</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx, src/components/layout/Header.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Sidebar refinements:**
- Replace plain "DriveShop" text with a more polished treatment: larger font weight, add "Event Estimate Engine" as a smaller subtitle below
- Add a subtle separator line between the brand area and nav items (already exists, but verify spacing)
- Polish the active nav item: ensure the blue left border + background contrast looks sharp
- Update the footer: replace "Phase 1 Discovery" / "v0.1.0" with "Phase 1 Discovery Intelligence Report" and current date "February 2026", slightly more visible text (zinc-400 instead of zinc-500/600)

**Header refinements:**
- Add a subtle bottom shadow or border treatment for visual separation from content
- Ensure the CONFIDENTIAL badge is clearly visible — keep destructive variant but verify it reads well
- Add a small "Prepared for DriveShop" or similar attribution text near the subtitle for professionalism

Do NOT add a logo image or external assets. Keep it text-based with Tailwind utilities only.
Do NOT change the navigation structure or routing.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, npm run lint passes, npm run typecheck passes</verify>
  <done>Sidebar has polished brand area with title + subtitle + date footer. Header has refined separation and professional attribution.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Page-level visual polish and consistent styling</name>
  <files>src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx, src/pages/RateCardPage.tsx, src/pages/AIScopingPage.tsx, src/index.css</files>
  <action>
**Consistent card elevation:**
- Ensure all Cards across pages have a consistent subtle shadow treatment. Add a subtle `shadow-sm` class to Card components if not already present via shadcn defaults. Do NOT override shadcn's Card component — apply via className where needed.

**Page header consistency:**
- Each page uses a bare h1 + p pattern. Add a very subtle bottom border or spacing below the page header area (a simple `pb-2 border-b border-border` on the header div, or just ensure consistent `space-y-6` gaps).
- Verify all three pages use consistent heading sizes and muted foreground for descriptions.

**Table polish:**
- Ensure table headers have a slightly stronger visual weight — verify they use `text-muted-foreground` and have proper bg treatment (shadcn default should handle this).
- Verify alternating row styling (`even:bg-muted/50`) is applied consistently where used.

**Chart polish:**
- Add `className="rounded-lg"` to chart Card wrappers if they don't already have rounded corners via shadcn defaults.
- Verify CartesianGrid uses consistent `strokeDasharray="3 3"` across all charts (already in place — just confirm).

**AI Scoping page:**
- The proof-of-concept banner uses inline oklch colors. This is fine for prototype. Keep as-is.
- Verify the form layout looks clean and professional with proper label alignment.

**Global polish (index.css):**
- If needed, add a subtle `scroll-smooth` to the html element or `antialiased` font smoothing to body. Only add if not already present.

Do NOT refactor components or extract new files. Keep changes minimal and styling-focused.
Do NOT change any data logic, API calls, or functionality.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, npm run lint passes, npm run typecheck passes</verify>
  <done>All three pages have consistent visual treatment — uniform card shadows, spacing, table styling, and professional typography. Build and lint pass.</done>

  <what-built>Complete visual polish pass: sidebar branding, header refinement, consistent card/table/chart styling across all pages</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:5173/dashboard
    3. Check sidebar: DriveShop branding with subtitle, polished nav items, date in footer
    4. Check header: "Phase 1 Discovery Intelligence Report" subtitle, CONFIDENTIAL badge visible
    5. Dashboard: All 4 tabs — verify charts look professional, cards have consistent elevation, tables are clean
    6. Navigate to Rate Card (/rate-card): verify search/sort/expand still works, consistent visual style
    7. Navigate to AI Scoping (/ai-assistant): verify form is clean and professional
    8. Overall: Does it feel like a Stripe/Linear-quality B2B enterprise tool?
